	  <h2>History</h2>
	  <p>eSports (also known as electronic sports, esports, e-sports, competitive (video) gaming, professional (video) gaming, or pro gaming) is a form of competition that is facilitated by electronic systems, particularly video games; the input of players and teams as well as the output of the eSports system are mediated by human-computer interfaces(Wiki). Esports now is a very hot word around the world. As 2016 league of legends world championship began last week, the attention they grabbed turning over to a new concept from simply playing computer games to a formal type of sport.</p>
